### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am Saloua Loussaoui, a skilled and dedicated software engineering student. With a passion for innovation and analytical thinking, I have experience in a range of web technologies, including ASP.NET MVC, React, AngularJS, jQuery, Python, and Flutter. I hold numerous internationally recognized certificates from leading organizations like Google, IBM, META, and others. I am currently seeking an internship in the field of data science to gain practical experience and expand my skillset. With a strong work ethic and the ability to learn quickly, I am confident in my ability to make a valuable contribution to any organization I work with.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is widely regarded as the world's first computer programmer. In the 19th century, she wrote the world's first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, paving the way for modern computing. As a software engineer, I'm proud to follow in Ada's footsteps and continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology!
